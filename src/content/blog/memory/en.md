# All That Has Passed Is But the Prelude

> _All the past, all is overtrue_.

Life is an endless journey forward, perpetually beginning anew. Gradually, we begin to forget so many people, so many things.......

Some say that's just how life isâ€”we meet so many people and experience so many things over a lifetime, how could we possibly remember them all?

Right, how could we possibly remember them all...

Here, I will record the memories I am gradually forgetting. When I see these words again, I hope I can still recall the memories that have slipped away...
